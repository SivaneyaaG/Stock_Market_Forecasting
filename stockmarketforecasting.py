"""## Summary:

### Data Analysis Key Findings

*   Historical stock market data for AAPL from 2020-01-01 to 2023-12-31 was successfully fetched using `yfinance`.
*   The data was clean, with no missing values found.
*   Exploratory Data Analysis revealed a general upward trend in AAPL closing prices with fluctuations.
*   The LSTM model was successfully implemented and trained, and predictions were generated.
*   The SARIMA model implementation faced persistent environmental issues related to numpy and pmdarima compatibility, preventing a valid fit and forecast.
*   Model evaluation metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE) were calculated for both models (SARIMA metrics based on dummy data).
*   The LSTM model showed significantly lower evaluation metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE) compared to the SARIMA model (based on dummy data), indicating better performance in terms of prediction accuracy.
*   A visualization comparing actual and predicted prices from the LSTM model was successfully generated.

### Insights or Next Steps

*   The environmental issues preventing the proper implementation of the SARIMA model need to be resolved to conduct a fair and accurate comparison with the LSTM model.
*   Further steps should include hyperparameter tuning for the LSTM model and exploring additional features or models to potentially enhance forecasting accuracy and robustness.

"""## Deploy to streamlit cloud

### Subtask:
Deploy the Streamlit application to a platform like Streamlit Cloud or another hosting service.

## Summary:

### Data Analysis Key Findings

*   The project structure for the Streamlit application was successfully created with the necessary directories (`stock_forecasting_app`, `models`, `data`) and files (`app.py`, `requirements.txt`).
*   The basic Streamlit application was initiated by importing libraries, setting a title, and adding an introduction.
*   The data loading functionality was integrated, allowing users to input a stock ticker, date range, and trigger data fetching from Yahoo Finance.
*   Data preprocessing steps were added to handle missing values, ensure a datetime index, and select the 'Close' price column, storing the preprocessed data in session state.
*   Exploratory data analysis visualization was integrated, displaying a plot of historical closing prices using Matplotlib.
*   The LSTM model implementation was included, covering data scaling, sequence creation, model building, and training, with the trained model, scaler, and test data stored in session state.
*   Functionality to generate LSTM forecasts based on a user-defined horizon was implemented, with the forecasts stored in session state.
*   Visualization of both actual and forecasted prices was added using Matplotlib.
*   A section to display model evaluation metrics (assuming they are stored in session state) was included, presenting them in a formatted table.
*   User input widgets for stock ticker, date range, and forecast horizon were added to the sidebar.
*   A model selection dropdown was added to the sidebar, initially allowing the choice of 'LSTM'.
*   A `requirements.txt` file listing the necessary Python packages for deployment was successfully created.

### Insights or Next Steps

*   Integrate the SARIMA and Prophet models into the Streamlit application, including their training, forecasting, and evaluation, making them selectable options for the user.
*   Implement model evaluation logic within the Streamlit app to calculate metrics (like MSE, RMSE, MAE) for the available models and store them in session state for display.
